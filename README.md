# Emulatv 

Emulatv is a little project for my personal use (but you are free to use it of course :D). It aims to emulate a TV App and made services (such as Netflix, Youtube etc...) accessible. 
I want it to run on a micro controller such as a Raspberry Pi, my personal phone (or any phones within the same network) would act as a tv controller. 

Another part of this project is for me to familiarize with full stack web development and deploiement.
